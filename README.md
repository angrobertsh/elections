[Electiongraphs live](https://angrobertsh.github.io/elections)

This project shows graphical representations of historical U.S. election data. It utilizes React.js with a Redux architectural framework on the frontend with d3 to generate SVG graphs. The data used by this tool was from the [presidential election data module](https://github.com/brandly/presidential-election-data).
